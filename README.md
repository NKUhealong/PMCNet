## Usage

1. Clone the repository, and download the pre-trained ImaenNet model, put them into ./ folder. 
   The details of the training are in train.py file.

2.  And then run the code：python train.py
    Note that the parameters and paths should be set beforehand

4. Once the training is complete, you can run the test.py to test your model.
   Run the code : python test.py.
